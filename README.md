# Recommender_Food_LDN
A recommendation system for restaurants in London, UK. Uses NLP and ML models on reviews in a TripAdvisor dataset. Currently in progress, preprocessing data is complete with a basic recommendation in place, now working on testing different approaches to provide more value through recommendation, looking at additional factors like location, price point, and other datasets.

Preprocessing included obtaining data from Google Maps using its API to obtain location and another source of review information to combine with the TripAdvisor dataset, providing a stronger data-backed recommendation.
